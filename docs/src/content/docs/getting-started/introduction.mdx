AgentForce ADK is a powerful TypeScript framework designed for creating, managing, and orchestrating AI Agent Workflows. Built with modern TypeScript practices, it provides a simple yet powerful interface to develop Agent-Based applications with support for multiple AI providers and models.

## What is AgentForce ADK?

AgentForce ADK (Agent Development Kit) simplifies the process of building AI-powered applications by providing:

- **Fluent Interface**: Method chaining for intuitive agent configuration
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Works with local (Ollama) and cloud (OpenRouter) providers
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- **Cross-Runtime**: Seamless operation across Bun, Node.js, and Deno
- **Server Capabilities**: Built-in HTTP server functionality for API deployment
- **OpenAI Compatibility**: Full support for OpenAI chat completions API format

## Key Concepts

### Agents
Agents are the core building blocks of AgentForce ADK. Each agent represents an AI-powered entity that can:
- Process prompts and generate responses
- Be configured with different AI providers and models
- Be deployed as HTTP endpoints
- Chain operations using a fluent interface

### Providers
Providers are the bridge between your agents and AI services:
- **Ollama**: Local model execution for privacy and development
- **OpenRouter**: Cloud-based access to multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta)
- **Native Providers**: Direct integration with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google (coming soon)

### Method Chaining
AgentForce ADK uses a fluent interface pattern that allows you to chain configuration methods:

```typescript
const agent = new AgentForceAgent(config)
  .useLLM("ollama", "gemma3:12b")
  .systemPrompt("You are a helpful assistant")
  .prompt("Hello, how can I help?")
  .output("json");
```
