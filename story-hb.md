Initialize AWS Account

**As a** DevOps Engineer
**I want** to automate the creation and configuration of a new AWS account, including setting up basic security and networking configurations, so that we can quickly and consistently provision environments for development, testing, and production.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   **Account Creation:** A new AWS account is successfully created with the specified parameters (account name, region, email address).
    *   Account details are accurately recorded in a centralized configuration management system.
    *   Account creation process is repeatable and automated.
*   **Security Configuration:** Basic security configurations are implemented, including enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the root user and creating an IAM user with limited privileges.
    *   Root user MFA is enforced.
    *   IAM user has appropriate permissions for initial setup and limited ongoing tasks.
    *   Security best practices are followed (e.g., least privilege).
*   **Networking Setup:** A basic VPC with public and private subnets is created, along with an internet gateway and route tables.
    *   VPC CIDR block is configurable.
    *   Subnet configurations are documented.
    *   Internet gateway is properly associated with the VPC.
*   **Billing and Cost Management:** Basic billing and cost management tools are enabled, such as AWS Cost Explorer and billing alerts.
    *   Cost Explorer is enabled and configured.
    *   Billing alerts are set up for exceeding a defined budget.

**Story Points:** 8

**Tasks:**

*   [ ] **Task 1: Script Development:** Develop a script (e.g., using AWS CloudFormation, Terraform, or AWS CLI) to automate the AWS account creation process.
*   [ ] **Task 2: IAM User Creation:** Implement the creation of an IAM user with limited privileges and assign appropriate policies.
*   [ ] **Task 2.1: MFA Enforcement:** Implement MFA enforcement for the root user.
*   [ ] **Task 3: VPC and Subnet Creation:** Implement the creation of a basic VPC with public and private subnets, internet gateway, and route tables.
*   [ ] **Task 3.1: CIDR Block Configuration:** Allow for configurable VPC CIDR block.
*   [ ] **Task 4: Billing and Cost Management Setup:** Enable AWS Cost Explorer and configure billing alerts.
*   [ ] **Task 5: Testing and Validation:** Test the automated account creation process in a non-production environment.
*   [ ] **Task 6: Documentation:** Document the automated account creation process, including prerequisites, configuration parameters, and troubleshooting steps.

**Environments:** 
- dev

**Notes/Dependencies:**

*   Dependency 1: Requires access to AWS APIs and necessary permissions.
*   Technical Requirements: Script must be idempotent (can be run multiple times without adverse effects).
*   Timeline Considerations: Account creation process should be completed within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., under 30 minutes).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Security:** Root account credentials must be securely managed and protected.  Automated scripts should not hardcode credentials.
*   **Performance:** Account creation process should be optimized for performance.
*   **Scalability:** The account creation process should be scalable to support the creation of multiple accounts.
*   **Maintainability:** The script should be well-documented and easy to maintain.
*   **Compliance:** Ensure compliance with relevant security and regulatory requirements.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Thoroughly test the automated account creation process in a non-production environment before deploying to production.

**Definition of Done:**

*   [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
*   [ ] Code is reviewed and approved
*   [ ] Unit tests written and passing (minimum 50% coverage)
*   [ ] Integration tests passing
*   [ ] Documentation updated
*   [ ] Feature tested in staging environment
*   [ ] Security review completed

**Solution Proposal:**

Utilize Terraform to define the infrastructure as code. Terraform allows for declarative configuration and provides a consistent approach to account creation across different AWS regions. The script will read configuration parameters from a secure configuration management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) to avoid hardcoding credentials.
