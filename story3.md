**User Story Title:** Initialize AWS Account for Development & Testing

**Story ID:** AWS-INIT-001 (You'll want a consistent numbering system)

**As a** DevOps Engineer
**I want** to have a properly configured AWS account ready for development and testing environments
**So that** our development teams can quickly and safely deploy and test applications without impacting production systems.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   **Account Creation:** An AWS account exists with a unique account ID.
*   **Basic Security Configuration:**
    *   Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled on the root account.
    *   A dedicated IAM user with programmatic access is created (e.g., `devops-user`).
    *   The `devops-user` has appropriate permissions to manage resources within the designated development/testing environment. (Specific permissions to be defined - see "Tasks" below).
*   **Region Selection:** The account is configured to use the designated AWS region for development/testing (e.g., `us-east-1`).
*   **Billing Setup:** Billing is enabled and linked to a valid payment method.  (Ideally, a dedicated billing alert is also set up - see "Tasks").
*   **Naming Conventions:** Resources within the account adhere to established naming conventions (e.g., prefixes for resource names).
*   **Tagging Strategy:** A basic tagging strategy is implemented for cost tracking and resource identification. (e.g., `Environment: Dev`, `Project: MyProject`).
*   **Initial Resource Limits:**  Initial AWS resource limits are reviewed and adjusted as needed for development/testing purposes (e.g., EC2 instance limits).
*   **Documentation:**  Basic documentation exists outlining the account setup, IAM user credentials (securely stored - *not* directly in the documentation!), and tagging strategy.

**Story Points:** 5 (Estimate based on complexity - adjust as needed)

**Tasks (Potential Breakdown - to be assigned to Developers/DevOps Engineers):**

*   [ ] **Task 1: Account Creation & Billing Setup (DevOps Engineer)** - Create the AWS account, verify billing is enabled, and link to a payment method.
*   [ ] **Task 2: IAM User Creation & MFA (DevOps Engineer)** - Create the `devops-user` IAM user, assign an initial password, and enforce MFA.
*   [ ] **Task 3: Initial Permission Set (DevOps Engineer)** - Define and assign an initial permission set to the `devops-user` (e.g., read-only access to EC2, S3, VPC).  *This needs to be very carefully considered and documented.*
*   [ ] **Task 4: Region Configuration (DevOps Engineer)** - Set the default region for the account.
*   [ ] **Task 5: Naming Convention Implementation (DevOps Engineer)** - Implement the agreed-upon naming conventions for resources.
*   [ ] **Task 6: Tagging Strategy Implementation (DevOps Engineer)** - Implement the basic tagging strategy.
*   [ ] **Task 7: Resource Limit Review (DevOps Engineer)** - Review and adjust initial resource limits as needed.
*   [ ] **Task 8: Documentation Creation (DevOps Engineer)** - Create basic documentation outlining the account setup.
*   [ ] **Task 9: Billing Alert Setup (DevOps Engineer)** - Configure a billing alert to notify the team of unexpected cost increases. (Consider using CloudWatch metrics and SNS).
*   [ ] **Task 10: Security Hardening (DevOps Engineer)** - Implement basic security hardening measures (e.g., restricting access to specific services).

**Environments:** dev

**Notes/Dependencies:**

*   Requires agreement on naming conventions and tagging strategy *before* implementation.
*   Requires a valid payment method for AWS billing.
*   Consider using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) to automate this process for repeatability and consistency.  (This might be a separate story/epic).
*   This story focuses on the *initial* setup.  Ongoing security reviews and updates will be required.


**Important Considerations (Read Carefully!):**

*   **Security:**  This is paramount.  The permissions granted to the `devops-user` *must* be carefully considered and documented.  Principle of Least Privilege applies.  Avoid granting overly broad permissions.
*   **Automation:**  While this story can be done manually, strongly consider automating this process with IaC.  Manual setup is error-prone and difficult to reproduce.
*   **Cost Management:**  Set up billing alerts *immediately* to prevent unexpected costs.
*   **Collaboration:**  This story requires close collaboration between DevOps and Development teams to ensure the account meets their needs.
*   **Secrets Management:**  *Never* store passwords or access keys directly in code or documentation. Use a secure secrets management solution (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault).
*   **Compliance:**  Ensure the account setup complies with any relevant security and compliance requirements.
*   **Environment Isolation:** This story assumes a dedicated AWS account for development/testing.  Consider the implications of shared accounts.
