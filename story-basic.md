**User Story Title:** Initialize AWS Account for Development Environment

**As a** DevOps Engineer
**I want** to set up a basic AWS account structure and initial configurations for our development environment
**So that** we have a secure and organized foundation for deploying and testing our application.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   **Account Setup:** The AWS account is created and accessible.
    *   Account name follows naming convention (e.g., `[ProjectName]-dev`).
    *   Account is tagged with relevant metadata (Project, Environment).
*   **Security Baseline:** Basic security configurations are implemented.
    *   Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the root account.
    *   Initial IAM users are created with limited privileges (least privilege principle).
    *   AWS CloudTrail is enabled for auditing.
*   **Networking Foundation:** A basic VPC is created.
    *   VPC CIDR block is defined.
    *   At least one public subnet is created.
*   **Billing & Cost Management:** Basic cost monitoring is enabled.
    *   AWS Cost Explorer is configured.
    *   Budget alerts are set up for initial cost monitoring.

**Story Points:** 5

**Tasks:**

*   [ ] **Task 1: Create AWS Account:** Create a new AWS account using the designated process.
*   [ ] **Task 2: Enable MFA:** Enable MFA on the root account.
*   [ ] **Task 3: Create IAM Users:** Create initial IAM users with restricted permissions.
*   [ ] **Task 4: Configure CloudTrail:** Enable AWS CloudTrail and configure logging to a designated S3 bucket.
*   [ ] **Task 5: Create VPC:** Create a VPC with a defined CIDR block and at least one public subnet.
*   [ ] **Task 6: Configure Cost Explorer:** Set up AWS Cost Explorer and configure basic cost monitoring.

**Environments:** 
- AWS [ dev ]

**Notes/Dependencies:**

*   **Dependency 1:** Requires approval from Finance team for AWS account creation.
*   **Technical Requirements:** Adherence to AWS security best practices and company naming conventions.
*   **Timeline Considerations:** Account creation can take up to 24 hours.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Security:** Root account access must be strictly controlled and monitored.  Implement least privilege access for all IAM users.
*   **Performance:** N/A - This is an initial setup task.
*   **Scalability:** The initial VPC configuration should be flexible enough to accommodate future growth.
*   **Maintainability:**  Document the account setup process for future reference and onboarding.
*   **Compliance:** Ensure compliance with relevant security and regulatory requirements.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Verify account creation, IAM user permissions, CloudTrail logging, and VPC configuration.

**Definition of Done:**

*   [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
*   [ ] Account creation process documented
*   [ ] IAM user permissions verified
*   [ ] CloudTrail logging confirmed
*   [ ] VPC configuration validated

**Solution Proposal:**

Utilize AWS Console for initial account setup.  Automate IAM user creation and CloudTrail configuration using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) principles (e.g., Terraform or CloudFormation) in a subsequent story.
