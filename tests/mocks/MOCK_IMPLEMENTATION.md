# Mock Data Implementation for AgentForce SDK Tests

## Overview

Successfully implemented mock data infrastructure for the AgentForce SDK's `run()` method tests, making all tests independent from external services like Ollama.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Mock Provider Infrastructure

**MockOllamaProvider** (`tests/mocks/MockOllamaProvider.ts`)
- Simulates Ollama API responses without requiring a running service
- Provides predictable, deterministic responses based on input patterns
- Maintains the same interface as the real OllamaProvider

### 2. Provider Injection System

**Enhanced run.ts** (`lib/methods/run.ts`)
- Added dependency injection for OllamaProvider
- Exported `injectOllamaProvider()` and `resetOllamaProvider()` functions
- Maintains backward compatibility with real API calls

```typescript
// For testing (inject mock)
injectOllamaProvider((model: string) => new MockOllamaProvider(model));

// For production (use real provider)
resetOllamaProvider();
```

### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite

**Updated run.test.ts** (`tests/run.test.ts`)
- All 11 tests now use mock data via `MockOllamaProvider`
- Tests cover both Ollama and non-Ollama providers
- Verifies method chaining, error handling, and response patterns
- Tests run in ~16ms (previously required running Ollama service)

## Key Benefits

### ✅ Test Independence
- Tests no longer require external services
- Can run in CI/CD environments without Ollama installation
- Fast and reliable test execution

### ✅ Predictable Responses
- Mock responses are deterministic based on input patterns
- Different responses for "hello", "joke", "test", and generic prompts
- Error simulation capabilities for testing error handling

### ✅ Backward Compatibility
- Production code unchanged - still uses real OllamaProvider by default
- Mock injection only used during testing
- Real API calls work exactly as before

### ✅ Comprehensive Coverage
- Tests cover all scenarios: chainability, error handling, different providers
- Validates log messages and execution flow
- Tests both Ollama-specific and generic provider behavior

## Test Results

```
✓ All 77 tests pass (including 11 run() method tests)
✓ Tests run in ~56ms total
✓ No external dependencies required
✓ Mock responses are consistent and predictable
```

## Example Usage

### In Tests
```typescript
import { injectOllamaProvider, resetOllamaProvider } from "@lib/methods/run";
import { MockOllamaProvider } from "./mocks/MockOllamaProvider";

beforeEach(() => {
    // Use mock provider for testing
    injectOllamaProvider((model: string) => new MockOllamaProvider(model));
});

afterEach(() => {
    // Reset to real provider
    resetOllamaProvider();
});
```

### In Production
```typescript
// No changes needed - works exactly as before
const agent = new AgentForceAgent(config);
await agent
    .useLLM("ollama", "llama2")
    .systemPrompt("You are helpful")
    .prompt("Hello")
    .run(); // Uses real OllamaProvider
```

## Mock Response Patterns

The `MockOllamaProvider` provides different responses based on input:

- **"hello"** → "Hello there! I'm a mock AI assistant ready to help you."
- **"joke"** → "Why don't pirates use computers? Because they prefer to navigate by the stars! Arrr! (Mock response)"
- **"test"** → "This is a mock test response. No real API call was made."
- **Empty prompt** → "I'm here and ready to assist! Please let me know what you need."
- **"error"** → Throws error for testing error handling
- **Other** → "Mock response to: '[user input]'"

## Demo Files

Created comprehensive demos:
- `examples/run-demo.ts` - Shows real Ollama execution
- `examples/mock-vs-real-demo.ts` - Demonstrates both mock and real modes

## Architecture Benefits

### Dependency Injection Pattern
- Clean separation between testing and production
- Easy to extend for other providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- No modification of core business logic

### Provider Abstraction
- Consistent interface across providers
- Easy to add new mock providers
- Type-safe implementation

### Test Quality
- Fast execution (no network calls)
- Deterministic results
- Independent test runs
- Better CI/CD integration

## Future Extensions

This pattern can be easily extended to:
- Mock OpenAI provider for OpenAI tests
- Mock Anthropic provider for Anthropic tests
- Mock Google provider for Google tests
- Different response scenarios (errors, timeouts, etc.)

## Summary

The mock data implementation successfully achieves the goal of making tests independent from external services while maintaining full functionality for production use. All tests pass consistently and quickly, making the SDK more reliable and easier to develop.
