As a DevOps Engineer
I want to initialize the AWS account with foundational resources and configurations
So that we have a secure and well-structured environment for subsequent deployments.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   **Account Structure:** The AWS account is organized with appropriate Organizational Units (OUs) and tags for resource management.
    *   OUs are created based on the defined organizational structure (e.g., Development, Staging, Production).
    *   A consistent tagging strategy is implemented for all resources.
*   **Security Baseline:** Basic security configurations are implemented to minimize risk.
    *   Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is enabled for the root account and IAM users.
    *   Initial IAM users are created with least privilege access.
    *   AWS CloudTrail is enabled to log API activity.
*   **Networking Foundation:** A basic VPC is created with necessary subnets and security groups.
    *   A default VPC is created with public and private subnets.
    *   Basic security groups are configured for inbound and outbound traffic.
*   **Billing and Cost Management:** Cost tracking and alerting mechanisms are set up.
    *   AWS Cost Explorer is enabled.
    *   Basic cost alerts are configured for unexpected spending.

**Story Points:** 5

**Tasks:**

*   [ ] **Task 1:** Create AWS Organizational Unit (OU) structure - Define and create OUs based on the organizational structure document.
*   [ ] **Task 2:** Implement Tagging Strategy - Define and implement a consistent tagging strategy for all AWS resources.
*   [ ] **Task 2:** Create Initial IAM Users - Create initial IAM users with appropriate permissions and MFA enabled.
*   [ ] **Task 3:** Enable AWS CloudTrail - Configure CloudTrail to log API activity to an S3 bucket.
*   [ ] **Task 4:** Create Default VPC - Create a default VPC with public and private subnets.
*   [ ] **Task 5:** Configure Basic Security Groups - Create basic security groups for inbound and outbound traffic.
*   [ ] **Task 2:** Enable AWS Cost Explorer - Configure Cost Explorer and set up basic cost alerts.

**Environments:**
- AWS Account [ prod ]

**Notes/Dependencies:**

*   Dependency 1: Requires access to the AWS console or CLI with appropriate permissions to create and manage resources.
*   Technical Requirements: Adherence to AWS best practices for security and resource management.
*   Timeline Considerations: This is a foundational task and should be completed before any other deployments.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Security:** Root account access should be strictly controlled and MFA enforced.  Least privilege access should be applied to all IAM users.
*   **Performance:** Not applicable for this foundational task.
*   **Scalability:** The initial configuration should be designed to accommodate future growth.
*   **Maintainability:** Tagging strategy and naming conventions should be well-documented and consistently applied.
*   **Compliance:** Ensure compliance with relevant industry regulations and internal policies.
*   **Testing Strategy:** Verify that all configurations are implemented correctly and that resources are accessible as expected.

**Definition of Done:**

*   [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
*   [ ] IAM users created and verified
*   [ ] CloudTrail logging is active and verifiable
*   [ ] VPC and subnets created and accessible
*   [ ] Cost Explorer is enabled and alerts are configured
*   [ ] Documentation updated with account configuration details

**Solution Proposal:**

Utilize AWS CLI or Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or CloudFormation to automate the account initialization process. This ensures consistency and repeatability.  Consider using a pre-approved AWS Landing Zone template as a starting point.
