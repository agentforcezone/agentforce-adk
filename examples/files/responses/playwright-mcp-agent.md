I visited https://docs.agentforce.zone/ and reviewed the documentation site. Summary:

High-level purpose
- AgentForceZone is a platform and toolkit for building AI agents and automations. The docs focus on the AgentForce Agent Development Kit (ADK) to design, build, and deploy intelligent agents.

Top-level structure (what you’ll find)
- Homepage: hero messaging — "Build Your AI-Agents. Automate Anything. Within your AgentForceZone." Calls to action: "Get Started with AgentForce ADK" and "Explore Examples".
- Main nav items visible on the site: Agents, Workflows, Server (header links).
- ADK docs section (detailed docs under /adk) with left-hand navigation including:
  - Getting Started: Installation, Provider Setup, Quick Start, Server Mode
  - Guides
  - Examples (including basic example at /adk/examples/basic/)
- GitHub link to the ADK repository: https://github.com/agentforcezone/agentforce-adk
- Search and theme toggle UI on the docs site.

Content highlights
- Promoted as a "Next‑Gen AI‑Agent Toolkit".
- Short code example on the homepage showing usage of the ADK (import { AgentForceAgent } from "@agentforce/adk") and a basic agent snippet (basic-agent.ts).
- Examples and walkthroughs to get started quickly, plus guidance for running the system in server mode.

Notable URLs
- Documentation root: https://docs.agentforce.zone/
- ADK docs: https://docs.agentforce.zone/adk/
- Basic examples: https://docs.agentforce.zone/adk/examples/basic/
- GitHub: https://github.com/agentforcezone/agentforce-adk

Recommendation (if you plan to use it)
- Start with ADK → Getting Started → Quick Start, then review Examples to see working agent code. Check the GitHub repo for source and releases.

If you want, I can:
- Pull and summarize a specific ADK page (Installation, Quick Start, or Examples).
- Extract the code from the basic-agent example and explain how to run it.
