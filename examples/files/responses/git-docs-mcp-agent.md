## Getting Started

The installation is straightforward through multiple package managers:
- npm: `npm install @agentforce/adk`
- JSR: `npx jsr add @agentforce/adk`
- Bun: `bun add @agentforce/adk`

## Example Usage

A simple agent can be created in just a few lines of code:

```typescript
import { AgentForceAgent } from "@agentforce/adk";

const agent = new AgentForceAgent({ name: "StoryTellerAgent" })
  .useLLM("ollama", "gemma3:4b")
  .systemPrompt("You are a creative story writer.")
  .prompt("Write a short story about AI and humanity.");

const response = await agent.output("md");
console.log(response);
```

## Current Status

The project is currently in **beta** phase and actively developing toward version 1.0.0, with ongoing improvements and feature additions planned.
