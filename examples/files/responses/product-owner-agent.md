Okay, here's a User Story for the new authentication system, following the provided prompt and guidelines. I'm aiming for clarity, detail, and actionability.

**User Story Title:** Implement Email/Password Authentication with 2FA Option

**As a** User
**I want** to be able to securely log in to the application using my email address and password, with the option to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security.
**So that** I can access my account safely and confidently, knowing my information is protected.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   **Login Functionality:**
    *   Users can successfully log in using a valid email address and password.
    *   The system displays an error message for invalid email/password combinations, providing clear guidance to the user.
    *   The system enforces password complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, special characters).
    *   The system securely stores user credentials (hashed and salted passwords).
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Enrollment:**
    *   Users can optionally enroll in 2FA using a time-based one-time password (TOTP) app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy).
    *   The system generates and displays a QR code for easy enrollment in the TOTP app.
    *   The system provides a backup code for users to regain access if they lose their TOTP app.
    *   The system validates the TOTP code entered by the user during login.
*   **Security & Compliance:**
    *   The system adheres to industry best practices for password storage and security.
    *   The system complies with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
    *   The system logs authentication attempts (successful and failed) for auditing purposes.
*   **User Experience:**
    *   The login page is clear, concise, and easy to understand.
    *   The 2FA enrollment process is intuitive and user-friendly.
    *   Error messages are informative and helpful.

**Story Points:** 13 (This is a complex feature with multiple components and security considerations)

**Tasks:**

*   [ ] **Task 1: Backend - Implement Email/Password Login API:** Develop the API endpoint for handling email/password login requests, including validation and authentication.
*   [ ] **Task 1.1: Backend - Implement Password Hashing and Salting:** Securely store user passwords using a robust hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) and a unique salt.
*   [ ] **Task 2: Backend - Implement 2FA Enrollment API:** Develop the API endpoint for handling 2FA enrollment requests, including QR code generation and backup code creation.
*   [ ] **Task 3: Frontend - Develop Login Page:** Create the user interface for the login page, including fields for email and password, and a button to submit the login request.
*   [ ] **Task 3.1: Frontend - Integrate with Backend Login API:** Connect the login page to the backend login API to handle login requests.
*   [ ] **Task 4: Frontend - Develop 2FA Enrollment Page:** Create the user interface for the 2FA enrollment page, including a QR code display and instructions for using a TOTP app.
*   [ ] **Task 4.1: Frontend - Integrate with Backend 2FA Enrollment API:** Connect the 2FA enrollment page to the backend 2FA enrollment API.
*   [ ] **Task 5: Testing - Implement Unit and Integration Tests:** Write comprehensive unit and integration tests to verify the functionality and security of the authentication system.
*   [ ] **Task 6: Documentation - Update API Documentation:** Document the new authentication API endpoints for developers.

**Environments:**
- `dev` [ dev | stage | prod ]
- `stage` [ dev | stage | prod ]

**Notes/Dependencies:**

*   **Dependency 1:** Requires a secure password hashing library (e.g., bcrypt).
*   **Dependency 2:** Requires a QR code generation library.
*   **Technical Requirements:**  Must use HTTPS for all communication.  Consider rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
*   **Timeline Considerations:**  Security review is critical and may require additional time.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Security:**  Regularly review and update security measures to protect against emerging threats.  Implement measures to prevent brute-force attacks and account takeover.
*   **Performance:**  Optimize the authentication process to minimize latency.
*   **Scalability:**  Design the system to handle a large number of users.
*   **Maintainability:**  Write clean, well-documented code.
*   **Compliance:**  Ensure compliance with relevant data privacy regulations.
*   **Testing Strategy:**  Focus on security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning.

**Solution Proposal:**

Utilize a well-established authentication library (e.g., Passport.js) to simplify the implementation and ensure security best practices are followed.  Implement a rate-limiting mechanism to prevent brute-force attacks.  Consider using a managed authentication service (e.g., Auth0, Firebase Authentication) to offload the complexity of authentication management.

**Definition of Done:**

*   [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
*   [ ] Code is reviewed and approved
*   [ ] Unit tests written and passing (minimum 20% coverage)
*   [ ] Integration tests passing
*   [ ] Documentation updated
*   [ ] Feature tested in staging environment
*   [ ] Security review completed (including penetration testing)
