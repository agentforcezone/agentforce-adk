Okay, here's a User Story for the new authentication system, following the provided prompt and guidelines. I'm aiming for clarity, detail, and actionability.

**User Story Title:** Implement Email/Password Authentication with 2FA Option

**As a** User
**I want** to be able to securely log in to the application using my email address and password, with the option to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security.
**So that** I can access my account safely and confidently, knowing my information is protected.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   **Login Functionality:**
    *   Users can successfully log in using a valid email address and password.
    *   The system displays an error message for invalid email/password combinations.
    *   The system enforces password complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, special characters).
    *   The system provides a "Forgot Password" flow for users who have forgotten their password.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
    *   Users can optionally enable 2FA during the login process.
    *   The system supports TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) as the 2FA method.
    *   The system provides clear instructions on how to set up and use 2FA.
    *   The system generates and displays a QR code for easy setup with authenticator apps.
    *   Users can disable 2FA if they choose to.
*   **Security:**
    *   Passwords are securely hashed and salted in the database.
    *   Sensitive data (e.g., passwords, 2FA secrets) is encrypted in transit and at rest.
    *   The system is protected against common authentication vulnerabilities (e.g., brute-force attacks, credential stuffing).
*   **User Experience:**
    *   The login process is intuitive and easy to understand.
    *   Error messages are clear and helpful.
    *   The system provides visual cues to guide users through the authentication process.

**Story Points:** 13 (This is a complex feature with significant security implications)

**Tasks:**

*   [ ] **Task 1: Backend - Implement Email/Password Login API:** Develop the API endpoint for handling email/password login requests, including password hashing and validation.
*   [ ] **Task 2: Backend - Implement 2FA API:** Develop the API endpoints for enabling, disabling, and verifying 2FA.
*   [ ] **Task 3: Frontend - Develop Login Form:** Create the login form with email, password, and 2FA toggle.
*   [ ] **Task 4: Frontend - Integrate with Backend APIs:** Connect the login form to the backend APIs for authentication.
*   [ ] **Task 5: Frontend - Display 2FA Setup Instructions:** Provide clear instructions and a QR code for setting up 2FA.
*   [ ] **Task 6: Security - Implement Rate Limiting:** Protect against brute-force attacks by implementing rate limiting on login attempts.
*   [ ] **Task 7: Security - Review and Test Security Measures:** Conduct a thorough security review and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
*   [ ] **Task 8: Documentation - Update User Documentation:** Update the user documentation to reflect the new authentication system and 2FA options.

**Environments:**
- `dev` [ dev | stage | prod ]
- `stage` [ dev | stage | prod ]

**Notes/Dependencies:**

*   **Dependency 1:** Requires a secure password hashing library (e.g., bcrypt).
*   **Dependency 2:** Requires a secure storage mechanism for 2FA secrets.
*   **Technical Requirements:**  Must adhere to OWASP guidelines for authentication.
*   **Timeline Considerations:**  Security review and testing should be prioritized.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Security:**  Must be resistant to common authentication attacks.  Regular security audits are essential.
*   **Performance:**  Login process should be fast and responsive.
*   **Scalability:**  Authentication system should be able to handle a large number of users.
*   **Maintainability:**  Code should be well-documented and easy to maintain.
*   **Compliance:**  Must comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).
*   **Testing Strategy:**  Comprehensive unit, integration, and security testing is required.

**Solution Proposal:**

Utilize a well-established password hashing library like bcrypt for secure password storage. Implement TOTP for 2FA using a standard library.  Employ a secure storage mechanism (e.g., encrypted database field) for storing 2FA secrets.  Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
