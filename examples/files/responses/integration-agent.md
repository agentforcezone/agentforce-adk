**User Story – Project Initialization for Game Development Marketplace Website**

| **Item** | **Description** |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Title** | Project Initialization – Game Development Marketplace Website |
| **As a** | Product Owner (or project lead) |
| **I want** | To complete a formal project initialization for the Game Development Marketplace website |
| **So that** | The development team has a clear, documented starting point, a consistent technical foundation, and an initial backlog that can be immediately worked on. |

---

### Acceptance Criteria

| # | Criterion | Test / Verification |
|---|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Git Repository** | A public GitHub repository is created (`game-dev-marketplace`) containing the initial commit(s). |
| 2 | **Folder Structure** | Repository contains a standard structure (`src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `config/`, `scripts/`). |
| 3 | **README** | README.md includes: <br>- Project description <br>- Quick start (setup, run, test) <br>- Project conventions (coding style, branching model) <br>- Contact & contribution guidelines. |
| 4 | **CI/CD Pipeline** | GitHub Actions (or equivalent) is configured to run: <br>- Linting (`eslint`, `prettier`) <br>- Unit tests (`jest` or `pytest`) <br>- Build verification. |
| 5 | **Initial Landing Page** | A minimal HTML/CSS/JS landing page is in `src/` showing: <br>- Project logo <br>- Brief tagline <br>- “Coming Soon” placeholder. |
| 6 | **Database Skeleton** | A PostgreSQL (or chosen DB) schema is defined in `config/db_schema.sql` with tables: `users`, `games`, `listings`. |
| 7 | **Issue Tracker Setup** | GitHub Issues board initialized with categories: “Backlog”, “In Progress”, “Done”. |
| 8 | **Initial Backlog** | At least 5 Epics/User Stories are created in Jira (or equivalent) covering core marketplace features (e.g., user registration, game listing, search, review system, admin dashboard). |
| 9 | **Kick‑off Documentation** | A `Kickoff.md` file summarizing: <br>- Project vision <br>- Success criteria <br>- Roles & responsibilities <br>- Timeline & milestones. |
| 10 | **Version Control Best Practices** | Branching strategy documented (e.g., GitFlow or trunk-based) and default branch protected. |

---

### Estimation

| **Metric** | **Value** |
|------------|-----------|
| Story Points | 8 (medium complexity, requires coordination across repo setup, documentation, and CI) |
| Effort | ~2 days of combined effort (repo & CI setup + documentation) |

---

### Notes & Dependencies

- The repository URL and CI configuration must be accessible to all stakeholders before the first sprint planning session.  
- The database schema may be revised during the first sprint; versioning will be handled via migrations.  
- All setup should follow the company’s Open Source License policy (MIT/Apache‑2.0 as applicable).
