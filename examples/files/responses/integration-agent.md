**User Story – Project Initialization for the Game Development Marketplace Website**

---

**As a** Project Manager / Technical Lead,  
**I want** to initialize the Game Development Marketplace website project with a clean, well‑structured repository, baseline infrastructure, and essential documentation,  
**so that** the entire team can start development on a solid foundation, maintain consistency, and avoid technical debt from the outset.

### Acceptance Criteria

| # | Criterion | How to Verify |
|---|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | A public Git repository is created on the company’s Git platform (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket) with the repo name `game-dev-marketplace`. | Repo URL is accessible; owner permissions are correctly set. |
| 2 | The repository contains a standard folder structure: `src/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`, `config/`, `assets/`. | Directory tree matches the specification. |
| 3 | A `README.md` is added that includes: project overview, setup instructions, contribution guidelines, and a high‑level architecture diagram. | README renders correctly on the platform and contains all required sections. |
| 4 | A `CONTRIBUTING.md` file exists, outlining coding standards, commit conventions, and code review process. | File present and references the coding style guide. |
| 5 | A CI pipeline (GitHub Actions / GitLab CI) is configured to run linting and unit tests on every push to `main` and on pull requests. | CI runs automatically and passes on sample commit. |
| 6 | A `LICENSE` file (MIT / Apache 2.0) is added. | License text is present and correctly formatted. |
| 7 | The initial project skeleton includes: a basic Express/Node.js or Django/Flask app (depending on stack decisions), or a minimal Next.js/React app if front‑end driven, with a single “Hello World” endpoint/page. | Running `npm start` / `python manage.py runserver` shows “Hello World” output. |
| 8 | A `.gitignore` file is created covering typical node or python files, OS files, and build artifacts. | The file contains standard entries (`node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, `.env`, etc.). |
| 9 | A `.env.example` is added with placeholders for all required environment variables. | File includes keys like `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY`, `API_KEY`, etc. |
|10 | The architecture diagram in `docs/architecture.md` or as an image in `docs/` explains: <br>• Backend services (API, auth, DB) <br>• Front‑end architecture <br>• Deployment pipeline <br>• Key third‑party integrations | Diagram is clear, up‑to‑date, and referenced in the README. |
|11 | An initial version tag `v0.1.0` is created in Git. | Tag exists and points at the commit containing the skeleton. |
|12 | All files are committed with a clear, descriptive commit message: “Initial project scaffold – basic repo, CI, docs.” | Commit tree shows the message and the correct changes. |

### Suggested Tasks (Kanban/Task List)

1. **Create Repository** – Set up the repo on Git platform, add contributors, set visibility.
2. **Define Folder Structure** – `mkdir -p src/tests/docs/scripts/config/assets`.
3. **Add Boilerplate Code** – Initialize Node/Express or Django/Flask skeleton; add `index.js` or `app.py`.
4. **Write README** – Include project description, stack, setup steps, and architecture diagram reference.
5. **Add CONTRIBUTING guide** – Describe coding standards, commit patterns, PR process.
6. **Add LICENSE** – Choose open‑source license, add file.
7. **Add `.gitignore`** – Use standard template for chosen language/framework.
8. **Add `.env.example`** – List required env vars with sample values.
9. **Setup CI** – Add GitHub Actions workflow (`node-ci.yml` / `python-ci.yml`) with lint/test steps.
10. **Create Architecture Diagram** – Use draw.io or Lucidchart; export to PNG/MD.
11. **Tag Release** – `git tag v0.1.0` and push tags.
12. **Commit & Push** – Push all changes, create initial PR if needed.

### Deliverables

- Public Git repository (`game-dev-marketplace`) with the initial commit.
- README, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE, `.gitignore`, `.env.example` in place.
- CI pipeline running on every push/PR.
- Architecture diagram in `docs/` or embedded in README.
- Tag `v0.1.0` created and pushed.

**Outcome:** The team now has a clean, documented, and CI‑enabled foundation to start building the Game Development Marketplace site, ensuring consistency, traceability, and rapid onboarding for new contributors.
